## Project Build Requirements

To generate documentation, you need to install Doxygen.
Here are my steps (on OS X).

~~~
curl -O http://ftp.stack.nl/pub/users/dimitri/Doxygen-1.8.13.dmg
~~~

Generate a configuration file for the project.

~~~
/Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/Resources/doxygen -g
~~~

The above command generates a file named _Doxyfile_.
Read through this file and make adjustments to the
following variables.

~~~
PROJECT_NAME = gen_video
EXTRACT_PRIVATE = YES
GENERATE_LATEX = NO
~~~

To generate documentation, run doxygen with no arguments.

~~~
doxygen
~~~

This generates a folder named _html_ containing the documentation.
The following is one way to open the documentation.

~~~
open -a "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" html/index.html
~~~

Alternatively, run _gendoc.sh_.

~~~
chmod +x gendoc.sh
./gendoc.sh
~~~
